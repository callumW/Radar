## Installation (TO DO: Make this better!!)
1. Run CMake in the Radar directory (Radar/) where the file [CMakeLists.txt]
(CMakeLists.txt) lives. **Note:** It is highly recommended you make the build
directory outside of the source directory.
2. Navigate to the build directory and run your chosen make system / open it
with your chosen IDE.
3. Before running the compiled program make sure to copy the SDL.dll into the
same directory as the executable (on windows only).

## Tested Systems:
- Windows:
